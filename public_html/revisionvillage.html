    <h1>Revision Village Questions</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p1>Due to how HTML files open on Google Drive, you will first need to download this zipfile which contains all 4 IB math courses' Revision Village questions.
    <br>
    <p1>Once downloaded, expand, and read through the "Setup and FAQ" PDF if you want to.</p1>
    <br>
    <p1>You can then navigate using the folders, and click on the HTML files to open up questions. Doing this will open a new window in your default browser, and it will look like a website.</p1>

    <p1><i>In theory, this file is on a "blockchain" and will never be taken down because it's hosted decentrally. However, we suspect it's not really on the blockchain becuase the website has got to be hosted centrally somewhere... So enjoy the "permanent" hosting of these RV questions while it lasts!</i></p1>
