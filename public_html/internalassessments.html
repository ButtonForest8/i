    <h1>Internal Assessments</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p1>The following are direct links to certain subjects' internal assessments.
    <br>
    <p1>There's not much here yet, but we are looking into finding more.</p1>
    <br>
    <p1>Disclaimer: The creators of this website are not the ones responsible for uploading of these past papers. We have just as much control as you when it comes to the accessibility of these files.</p1>
    <br>
    <p1><i>The links are confirmed to work as of: <b>Oct 28 2022</b></i></p1>

    <button><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mbIzRXrLQ4ExFFz6YZeKRi6SZB5M_S0m?usp=sharing">Chemistry IAs (4 exemplars)</a></button>
    <br><br>
    <button><a href="https://www.clastify.com">IAs in almost everything (Clastify)</a></button>
    <br><br>
    <p1>Note: Clastify is a database of student-uploaded IAs, TOK essays, and EEs. However, they charge for the best documents, and it is unclear how accurate the marking of them are. The two first links, while not as useful, have official IB examiner commentary (the math one is especially useful as it has 49 examples, with markschemes and commentary). </p1>
