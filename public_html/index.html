    <p1>If you really can't stand the basic HTML, please feel free to make your own website.</p1>
    <br><br>
    <p1>We don't want to have the same fate as <a href="https://examsnap.io">Examsnap</a> or <a href="https://ibdocuments.com">IBDocuments.com</a>! We therefore don't host textbooks and LitCharts, as we don't want to anger all those giant publishers like Oxford, Cambridge, Pearson, etc.</p1>
    <br><br>
    <p1>
    <br>The current webhoster limits our bandwidth heavily, so please don't use this website more than you need! We're looking into getting an alternate webhoster if it gets really busy. DDOSing is mean! :(</p1>
